Image Label Prediction Using KNN Algorithm

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python to predict labels for images from the Hoda dataset.

Prerequisites:
To run this project, install the following libraries:
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib numpy opencv-python

Dataset:
The project utilizes the Hoda dataset (load_hoda), which contains handwritten Persian digit images. Ensure the dataset is available in your environment or refer to the dataset documentation for access.

Project Structure:
Image_Label_Prediction.ipynb: Main notebook containing the KNN implementation for image label prediction.
dataset.py: Script to load the Hoda dataset (ensure it's available in your project directory).

Results:

The KNN model (n_neighbors=3) is trained on the Hoda dataset to classify images. For detailed performance metrics, refer to the notebook outputs.
